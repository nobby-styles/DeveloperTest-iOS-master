        author: "Eve Bartlett",
        content: "Facebook has announced plans to integrate brain-computer interface (BCI) technology into their platform, allowing users to control their devices and access their social media accounts using only their thoughts. The technology, which has been in development for several years, uses electrodes placed on the scalp to detect brain activity and interpret it as commands. This could potentially revolutionize the way we interact with technology, but also raises concerns about the privacy and security of user data. Facebook plans to roll out the technology in stages, starting with a limited number of users in select regions.",
